# Man_following_bag
The project is build such that through user's smartphone we can make the trolley bag follow him. The project is only a working prototype as of now.

This project uses various sensors and Arduino uno and Mega microcontroller. The Arduino will be fit on trolley bag and there will one sensor for direction-angle of the user. Through user's mobile, we will get the GPS location, and send it to trolley bad through bluetooth with MIT App Inventor. Then Arduino will recieve GPS signals and after some calculation, the trolley will move.

This project was done in collaboration with Nisarg Sheth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisarg-sheth)
